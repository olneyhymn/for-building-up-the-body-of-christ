    title: Writings and Audio from Tim Hopper
    Content: |
      I'm dedicated to serving Christ, committed as a husband,
      father, and deacon within the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Here, you'll find a
      collection of my theological writings and links to podcasts where I've shared my
      insights. While primarily organized for my own reference, I aim for these
      resources to be beneficial to others too.


      > ...for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith...
