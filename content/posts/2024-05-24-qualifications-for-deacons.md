*The following are notes from a lesson I taught to our men's leadership class at Shiloh Presbyterian Church in 2018. [You can listen to the audio of the session here](https://www.sermonaudio.com/solo/shiloh/sermons/99117182130480/).*

# Acts 6 Background of the Diaconate

*Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, “It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.*

*And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith. (ESV)*

## First Task: Manifold Ministry of Mercy

### OPC Book of Church Order:

*The Scriptures designate the office of deacon as distinct and perpetual in the church.* ***Deacons are called to show forth the compassion of Christ in a manifold ministry of mercy toward the saints and strangers on behalf of the church.*** *To this end they exercise, in the fellowship of the church, a recognized stewardship of care and of gifts for those in need or distress. This service is distinct from that of rule in the church.*

### Cornelius Van Dam:

*Deacons need to focus on the poor and needy, on the lonely and sick—indeed, on all those whose joy in the Lord is being challenged by their circumstances.*

## Second Task: Freeing the Elders from this duty

“It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.”

### OPC Book of Church Order:

*Other forms of service for the church may also be committed to the deacons.*

### John G. Lorimer:

*Even as matters stand, with all the aid which he derives from elders, there are many matters he would rather wish to commit to the hands of deacons, as appropriate to them; and besides this,* ***it is comforting and animating for a pastor to be surrounded by a large body of intelligent men, interested in the poor and the financial affairs of the Church.*** *He feels, that amid all his own difficulties and discouragements, he is not standing alone—that others are alive to his circumstances, and sympathize with him, and are forward to aid him—and that he can have their advice and cooperation in many matters which are otherwise fitted to distract and to burden. This is a source of comfort and strength, even though he may not, as pastor, have frequent occasion to call for their assistance.*

# Ordination and Office

“Deacon” in Greek is *diakonos*, “one who executes the commands of another, esp. of a master, a servant, attendant, minister.” Its usage is much more generic than that of the *office* of deacon.

* “But whoever would be great among you must be your *diakonos*” (Matthew 20)
* “For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's *diakonos* for your good.” (Romans 13)
* “For I tell you that Christ became a *diakonos* to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness...” (Romans 15)
* “I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a *diakonos* of the church at Cenchreae…” (Romans 16)
* “What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants [*diakonos*] through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.” (1 Corinthians 3)
* “But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister *[diakonos*] in the Lord , will make everything known to you.” (Ephesians 6)

The *diakonos* of 1 Timothy 3 is “tested first” before taking that title. He is more than a generic servant.

## OPC Book of Church Order:

> It being manifest by the Word of God that no man ought to take upon himself the office of deacon, ruling elder, or minister, the Scriptures declare that the church shall set men apart by solemn act for its service.
>
> Ordination is that act by which men are set apart to the offices of deacon, ruling elder, and minister. It is the church's solemn approval of and public attestation to a man's inward call, his gifts, and his calling by the church.

## Acts 6

*These they set before the apostles, and* ***they prayed and laid their hands on them.***

## OPC Report on the Committee of Women in Church Office

*The importance of office in the teaching of Scripture comes out clearly, when office is honored, even when subjective qualifications are lacking. A case in point is the apostle Paul's apology for his remark concerning the high priest Ananias, when the latter ordered him struck on the mouth (Acts 23:5). In answer to the question, "You dare to insult God's high priest?" Paul replied, quoting Exod. 22:28, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: 'Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.'"*

# Biblical Qualifications

## Of Good Repute (Acts 6)

*The devil will do anything to bring an office-bearer and the church into disrepute. Leaders in the church must be of irrefutable good repute. Such a sound reputation would include characteristics such as honesty, integrity, and holiness of life.* (Van Dam)

## Full of the Spirit (Acts 6)

*It is only true piety which, during a long succession of years, will sustain the heart in tenderness to the poor amid trials and difficulties, and which will uphold the deacon in the unwearied, and sometimes unrequited care of the house of God.* (Lorimer)

## Of Wisdom (Acts 6)

*And, lastly, he is to be a man of wisdom, a man of discernment and prudence, not carried away by the impulse of his feelings; but one able intelligently to judge between real and unreal cases of indigence, the proportion and manner in which charity should be dispensed, the best advice which the circumstances not only of the poor, but of the Church generally, in perplexing seasons may require.* (Lorimer)

## Must be Dignified (1 Timothy 3)

*The deacons were to be grave, not austere or morose, but of dignified gravity. Few things are more injurious to Christian influence, or more unsuitable for one whose business it is to dealing cases of distress and Christian distress, than levity, or even excessive pleasantry and lightheartedness. All instinctively feel that this is unbecoming. It never recommends the Gospel or the Christian Church to the favour of any.* (Lorimer)

## ​Not Double-tongued (1 Timothy 3)

*A deacon, to be relieved from the annoyances sometimes connected with the discharge of his duties, is tempted to put the poor off with insincere words—to say one thing to one man, and an opposite to another. He is in danger also, perhaps of promising to the pastor, and not fulfilling. This is justly fatal to character and to usefulness. It prevents confidence and creates contempt. The deacon, then, must be sincere.* (Lorimer)

See also James 3

## Not Addicted to Much Wine (1 Timothy 3)

*Who can conceive any thing more incongruous than a drunkard to be a distributor of alms to the pious poor, and a leading manager in the external affairs of the house of God, paying the minister, & c.?* (Lorimer)

## Not Greedy for Dishonest Gain (1 Timothy 3)

*Greed was a characteristic of false teachers (1 Tim. 6: 3–10; Titus 1: 11), but those holding office in the church must distance themselves from that (1 Tim. 3: 3; Titus 1: 7, 11; 1 Peter 5: 2). … He must work for the well-being of the congregation and not for selfish gain.* (Van Dam)

## Hold the Mystery of the Faith with a Clear Conscience (1 Timothy 3)

*He must be familiarly acquainted with the gospel of salvation, so that he may be able to speak of it, and to commend it to others, especially when dealing out among them the donations of charity.* ***A pious intelligent deacon may, in giving, make his alms preach.*** *He may, from the bread which perisheth, mount up to the true bread which came down from heaven, and bestow upon the indigent better gifts than money.* (Lorimer)

*The content of this mystery is therefore the promised Christ (Col. 1: 26–27; 2: 2; 1 Tim. 3: 16), who can now be proclaimed (Rom. 16: 25; 1 Cor. 4: 1).* (Van Dam)

*What are some of the ways that a deacon may teach? When deacons visit prisoners or the sick they bring spiritual encouragement.* **\*Often they teach people how to manage their personal affairs in a biblical way**, especially their finances.* **\*Deacons also teach others how to serve**. They do not have to accomplish all of the mercy ministry themselves, but they are responsible to make sure that it all gets done. So by word and by example, they teach the church how to serve. In the words of one manual for diaconal service, “It is their duty to develop the grace of liberality in the members of the church.”* **\*Then deacons must be ready to evangelize**. The first deacons, like Stephen and Philip (Acts 7–8), were great evangelists. So whenever deacons help the poor, they do it in the name of Jesus Christ, with a testimony of his saving power. Otherwise, the church becomes just another social service. To carry out their ministry of discipleship and evangelism, deacons must hold on to the deep truths of the faith.* (Ryken)

## Tested First (1 Timothy 3)

*The Bible gives freedom by not specifying how such officers are to be examined. Scrutiny is mandatory, according to the standards listed in this passage. How the scrutiny takes place is left to the discretion of the church. Often, deacons prove their worth by serving in other ministries.* (Ryken)

*The session shall certify those nominees whom, upon examination, it judges to possess the necessary qualifications for office.* (OPC Form of Government)

## Prove Themselves Blameless (1 Timothy 3)

*Like the elders (1 Tim. 3:6), deacons must not be recent converts but must have a credible track record of blameless Christian living, and no one should be able to bring a justifiable charge against their life and conduct (1 Tim. 3:2).* (Van Dam)

## Husband of One Wife (1 Timothy 3)

*A deacon must really be a husband to his wife, physically, spiritually and emotionally. He must love her and serve her. He must give himself to her the way Christ gave himself to the church (Eph. 5:25-28). How can he serve the people of God if he is not serving his own wife? ​*(Ryken)

Wives Must be Dignified, Not Slanderers, Sober-Minded, and Faithful in All Things (1 Timothy 3)

*With these qualifications, the wife of a deacon would be a great help for her husband and not be a hindrance or distraction from his work. Indeed, she would be an excellent support for his diaconal office.* (Van Dam)

## Managing Children and Household Well (1 Timothy 3)

*There are few things which, in the estimation of the world, discredit the head of a house more than having no authority at home, and bringing up a disorderly and disliked family of children.* (Lorimer)

## In Summary

Lorimer: *Animated by the spirit of his office, and acting out the character which the counsels of the Word imply, he will not be haughty, or harsh, or suspicious; he will not be cold, and formal, and repulsive, discharging his work as if it were a burden; he will be frank and easy in his intercourse with the poor; take an interest in their avocations, their health, and welfare; kind and tender, and sympathizing, especially when in sickness; but withal firm, and not easily persuaded to what his judgment does not approve. He will also have a deep conviction of the insufficiency of all his efforts to benefit the poor of his charge without the blessing of God, and hence he will not fail to seek that blessing in the exercise of diligent and persevering prayer for the Holy Spirit.*

Ryken: *The virtues listed here have little to do with talents or abilities. They are not the kinds of credentials that show up on most résumés. Instead, the biblical qualifications have to do with a person’s morals. God is more concerned with who deacons are than what they do. ​*

Ryken: *Finally, these qualifications are a worthy goal for anyone who might eventually become an officer in the church. Make yourself available to serve the Lord. Ask the Holy Spirit to make your life dignified, your doctrine sound, and your family stable. Even if you never become a deacon, your time will not have been wasted. The qualifications for deacons are simply the virtues of a Christian exercised to a supreme degree.* ​

## The Deacon’s Reward

*For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.* (1 Timothy 3)

*Although much of a deacon’s work is done in private, it is noticed and commended by God.* (Ryken)​
