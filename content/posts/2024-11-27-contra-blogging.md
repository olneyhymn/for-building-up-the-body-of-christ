_My college friends and I had a short-lived blog in 2009/2010. I wrote this post for them against blogging!_

Chris -

I said I was going to write a follow-up to your Wariness of Blogging post. I hope the picture of you didn’t set our dedicated readership’s expectations too high, because I don’t have a similarly handsome picture of myself to share.

My response, in short, is: I’m really feelin’ ya. I’ve considered starting a theology-related blog several times in the past few years, but I’ve repeatedly decided not to for several reasons. For one, of making many blogs there is no end, and much Google Reader is a weariness of the flesh. There are tons of blogs out there, including many that say what I want to say better than I ever could. I’m now subscribed to around 100 (!) blogs in Google Reader, and I’m undoubtedly only scratching the surface of blogs on topics I’m interested in.

But I’ve also question my motives for why I’d want to blog. As far as I can tell, my main motive is wanting people to be impressed with my depth of insight and breadth of knowledge. And why go to the interwebs to share my wisdom and knowledge? Mostly because I feel unappreciated by those around me. I mean, with all the people in the world who have internet access, there must be some people who are foolish enough to listen to what I have to say!

But if God has given me wisdom and insight, what has he given it for? I have to agree with Chris (and, I think, [the Spirit via Paul](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2012&version=ESV)): my gifts are for the common good of the body. What body? First and foremost, I think, the beautiful faces I see when I walk into the gym of Penny Rose Elementary School for the worship of Shiloh Presbyterian every Lord’s day morning and evening.

I wonder, sometimes, how some of the hotshot Christian bloggers (no names mentioned) actually interact with their local congregations. Monday through Saturday they’re influencing Christians around the world by their blogs, but do they show the same concern for the discipleship of the people on Sunday morning or at a poorly attended Wednesday prayer meeting? Despite how frustrating blog commenters can be, I suspect they’re rarely as frustrating as our brothers in church with their snotty-nosed kids, grumblings about their bosses, constant need for diaconal care, and excessive use of the church email prayer chain. There’s no “block” button for the guy who sits next to me in church.

I suspect blogs encourage abstract detached approach to our faith. I can sit here reading all day about the Federal Vision, the state of the PCA, the Christ-and-Culture debate, homosexuality and the church, and the lapsarian question (all valid and important topics of study) and come away quite proud of my doctrinal stances and cultural (non)engagement. Blogs turn people like me into arm chair ecclesiastic critics. Pathetic.

Undoubtedly, blogs didn’t invent these problems. Books have been around for a while. In finer societies, these matters came up in pubs. Our parents subscribed to magazines and newsletters. The difference, I think, is in the medium. (Dr. Gordon-Brownie-Point +1.) I get around 50 posts a day coming through Google Reader. And, with my prowess at keyboard shortcuts, I can skim through them in seconds while developing poorly informed opinions and criticisms of the broader church. Books (and even magazines), Dr. Gordon reminds us, by their very medium encourage a slower, more thoughtful analysis.

Now, as our beloved Irfon Hughes says around the middle of every sermon, let’s make some points of application.

1. God gifts his children gifts. These gifts are for the common good, for we are members one of another. If God has given wisdom and knowledge (as He has to my fine interlocutors), find ways to use it for local church before anything else. You might have start by teaching 4 year olds the Catechism; you’ve done more good than posting to a blog read by a thousand people.
2. Blogs are an incredible resource. Many of my thoughts on this matter flow out of years of reading the 9Marks Blog. Reading Justin Taylor, in my view, is an absolute must for anyone concerned with contemporary reformed(ish) faith and practice. Reformation21 offers a sporadic yet provocative perspective on the church. I urge blog reading, and, as a corollary, I urge blog writing. But each of needs to guard his heart in this regard. We must take great care to not become self-righteous armchair critics. Instead, we can and should read ecclesiastical blogs with hearts of care and concern for the Bride of Christ, concern that starts with the people around us at 9:45 on Sunday morning.
