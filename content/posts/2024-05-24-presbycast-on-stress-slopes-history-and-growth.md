I was invited on Presbycast for an episode called [Stress, Slopes, History, and Growth - What's Shaking in the Churches w/DG Hart & Friends](https://presbycast.libsyn.com/stress-slopes-history-and-growth-whats-shaking-in-the-churches-wdg-hart-friends). I shared about the growth in the OPC Presbytery of the South over the last several years.
