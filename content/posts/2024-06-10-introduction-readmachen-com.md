I recently launched a new website: [readmachen.com](https://readmachen.com). The site started as a digitization of the bibliography of Machenâ€™s works published in *Pressing Towards the Mark* (sadly out of print) by James Dennison and Grace Mullen. This bibliography is 25 pages long and lists nearly 400 books, articles, sermons, and letters from J. Gresham Machen published over the last 100 years.

The online version allows you to see the data in ways the print version doesn't; for example, you can view publications by [year](https://www.readmachen.com/years/) or [source](https://www.readmachen.com/sources/). I have also included the full-text content for as many articles as possible, and for Machen's books, I've provided links to where you can buy copies.

I welcome any feedback you have on this bibliographic website; in particular, if you notice any errors or missing pieces or know where I can get digital editions of any of the original sources, please let me know.
