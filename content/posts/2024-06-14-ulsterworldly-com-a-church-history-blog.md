I created ulsterworldly.com, a blog about the history of Presbyterianism, mainly to organize my notes and study. 

Many of the entries [relate to my own family](https://ulsterworldly.com/tags/family/), where Presbyterianism goes back to the [1560s in Scotland](https://ulsterworldly.com/post/scottish-barrons/).

My other primary area of interest is the [history of my own denomination](https://ulsterworldly.com/tags/opc/), the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

My prayer is that others will find these resources encouraging and strengthening as well.
